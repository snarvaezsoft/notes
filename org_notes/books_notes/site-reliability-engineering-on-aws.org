SRE Principles / DevOps
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Site_Reliability_Engineering


Reduce organizational Silos
  SRE shares ownership with devel9opers to create shared responsibility
  SREs use the same tools that developers use and vice versa
Implement gradual changes
  SRE encourages developers and product owners to move quickly by reducing the cost of failure
Measure everything
  SRE defines prescriptive ways to measure values
  SRE fundamentally believes that systems operation is a software problem
Accept failure as normal
  Indicators (SLIs) ans Service Level Objectives (SLOs)
  SRE mandates blameless post-mortems
Leverage tooling and automation
  SREs have a charter to automate menial tasks (called "toil") away
