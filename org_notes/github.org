* How to save username and password in GIT?

Make sure you are using the SSH URL for the GitHub repository rather than the HTTPS URL. It will ask for username and password when you are using HTTPS and not SSH.


#+BEGIN_SRC
git config --global user.name myusername
git config --global user.email myemail
git config --global github.user myusername
git config --global github.token mytoken

#+END_SRC


Run

#+BEGIN_SRC
git config --global credential.helper store
#+END_SRC


then

#+BEGIN_SRC
git pull
#+END_SRC

provide a username and password and those details will then be remembered later. The credentials are stored in a file on the disk, with the disk permissions of "just user readable/writable" but still in plaintext.

If you want to change the password later

git pull

Will fail, because the password is incorrect, git then removes the offending user+password from the ~/.git-credentials file, so now re-run

git pull

to provide a new password so it works as earlier.
